# CPC_at_LBNL

event_extractor_to specimages.py is the file used to pick out the 2000 microsecond windows

Some of the parameter may need to be changed if the targeted file name has changed. Will clean it up to make clearer afterwards. The tested quenches are q001, q003, q076, and q103.

Some of the files (not the extractor) might need the support of the DBCV clustering library.
